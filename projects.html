Mixed reality technology enables precise control the display projected to each of the user's eye, which can be employed for appropriate stimulation of the disabled vision apparatus. We are looking for solutions which will not only aid the casual treatment, but also reduce the troublesome aspects of the casual therapeutical approach. </p>

                    <p>Electrical capacitance tomography is one of the most compelling techiques within process control, especially when closed containers are concerned. We developed a system for real-time analysis of the measurement result for ECT setup, enabling both time-realted and spatial analysis of granular flows. The system was designed for tabletop and tablet operation, broadening the horizons for on-site process control.   </p>
