                    <h2> Automated Interactive Golf Coach</h2>

                     <p>Swingmate is an automated driving-range training tool for amateur golfers, enabling them to monitor their performance in real-time. Our solution expands standard facility of the driving range post through in-built sensory measurement system. Golfer's swing is assessed in terms of speed and impact angle. Further, the appropriate body balance is assessed through tensometric measurements under player's feet.</p>

               <div>
                     <p> Swingmate has been designed in close cooperation with top Polish players and coaches, as well as amateur adepts of golf. Our lead advisor - Amanda Majsterek, 4-time Polish Champion (Women Open) and professional coach - enabled us to deeply understand the problems of amateur players and advised us on the design of the solution.</p>
                    <p> Swingmate gathers three different types of data:
                        <ul>
                            <li> the speed of the club, measured just befor impact</li>
                            <li> the angle between the perpendicular impact line and the club face </li>
                            <li> tensometric measurment on player's feet balance</li>
                        </ul>

                        and analyses the swing in real time, providing feedback on the registered parameters right after the shot. The correctness of feet balance is presented live, through a LED display between player's feet. Therefore, players can improve their technique in every shot.</p>

                <p>Pilot studies on appropriate visualisation techniques has been performed. Currently, our team is working on application of new display methods and improving the performance of measurement system. When finished, a longitudinal study in the golf club is to be performed, to verify whether the device does have significant impact on progress made by the amateurs. </p>

                <p> The functional design of the solution has been recognised on multiple innovation fairs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Gold Medal on International Warsaw Invention Show IWIS 2018</li>
                        <li> Gold Prize on Seul International Invention Fair 2018</li>
                        <li> Thailand Award for Best International Invention (SIIF 2018)</li>
